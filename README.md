## Content
Dataset has the following columns:
- **language**: language the prompt is made in,
- **model**: type of the model (GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Uncensored GPT Version),
- **time**: time when the answer was generated,
- **text**: user's prompt,
- **response**: response generated by the model

The text corpus supports instruction tuning and supervised fine-tuning for larger language models, enhancing text generation and human language understanding. With a focus on generating human-like content, it is useful for evaluating LLMs, improving generation capabilities, and performing well in classification tasks. This dataset also assists in mitigating biases, supporting longer texts, and optimizing LLM architectures for more effective language processing and language understanding.
